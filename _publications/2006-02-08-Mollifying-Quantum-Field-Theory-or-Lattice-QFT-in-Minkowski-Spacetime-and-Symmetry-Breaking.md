excerpt: 'This work develops and applies the concept of mollification in order to smooth out highly oscillatory exponentials. This idea, known for quite a while in the mathematical community (mollifiers are a means to smooth distributions), is new to numerical Quantum Field Theory. It is potentially very useful for calculating phase transitions [highly oscillatory integrands in general], for computations with imaginary chemical potentials and Lattice QFT in Minkowski spacetime.'
